# Stock_Watson_Business_Cycle_Dynamics

This is the repository for HUL715: Time Series Econometrics and Forecasting, major exercise, paper replication. The codes have been written in R, and data files as used by me are in the Data folder. Along with it, the R markdown submission file, pdf (2016ME10824), the actual paper (Understanding Changes in International Business Cycle Dynamics, James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, Journal of the European Economic Association, 2005), and replication material (retrieved from http://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/publi.html) are also added.
